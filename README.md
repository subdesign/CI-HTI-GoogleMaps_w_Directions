# Codeigniter "How-to-implement" series part 4 - *Google Maps with Directions*

*This series objective is to demonstrate how to implement several libraries into Codeigniter*

***

#### Google Maps with Directions example is good for Contact forms, where the visitor can plan his route to your company address

## 1. Installation

Copy the package files into the corresponding folders. Google Maps library is already included.

## 2. Setup

The example works out of the box, but it is suggested to store your company info in database of config file.   

Also it's good to export a small png of you company logo, it looks better than the default Googla Maps marker icon. Controller has comments where you should do these settings.  

By default you can't set the directions language, but on line 1570 of Gmap.php you can set your custom language code.
